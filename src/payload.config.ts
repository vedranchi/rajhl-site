 * DATABASE_URL), so fall back to it — this keeps the app working against a stock
 * Supabase↔Vercel setup and survives credential rotation.
 *
 * The integration's URL carries `sslmode=require`, which recent node-postgres
 * coerces to `verify-full` and then rejects Supabase's self-signed cert chain —
 * and that string param overrides the pool's explicit `ssl` option. Strip
 * `sslmode` so our `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` governs (TLS stays on,
 * only the chain check is skipped).
